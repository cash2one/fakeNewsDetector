above all: Technology is for naught if you aren't solving a specific business problem.

"Make sure that you first understand what the problem truly is, then develop the best business practice for how to address that problem," said Brian Laughlin, IT architect of mobile devices and commercial aviation services at Boeing, at the event. "Then and only then can you apply the appropriate technology."

When it comes to Google, whose engineering team was at the conference to talk about the company's Google Glass device, the sage advice applies -- and doesn't.

With the development of Google Glass, the optical head-mounted display that looks like a pair of eyeglasses, the search giant seems to have operated in the reverse, inventing a device that had to discover the problem it was meant to solve.

Work on Google's assisted-reality eyewear certainly began with an idea of a problem to solve, said Jay Kothari, project lead for Glass at X, the moonshot factory. The ambition was to solve "the information overload problem." If Google engineers could put the world's information in your line of sight, then everyone in the world would be scrambling to get their hands on it.

That didn't happen, Kothari said. Since Google didn't really know what problem it was trying to solve with Glass, its engineers turned to "Explorers" -- qualified early adaptors -- to figure out the device's raison d'etre for them.

"The Explorer program was an experiment for us to take Glass, put it in the market as a piece of technology and ask 'what would you do with this technology?' 'What is this finally useful for?'" Kothari said. But the quest hit a dead end. "We got such a broad set of answers" -- none of which pointed to a use case that justified the device's existence in the consumer market.

A new chapter for the Google Glass project But at Google, there are no failures, just course corrections. If the consumer space was a bust, then why not take this amazing solution for a problem that no one besides Google engineers seemingly wanted to solve and try it out on ... the enterprise. Eureka. "We went from what we thought was a consumer fashion device to something that's very function-oriented and has a very clear use case," Kothari said. Again, the team first had to figure out what those "clear use cases" in the enterprise would be. Working with Explorers in a variety of industries, the Google team eventually learned what its nifty creation was meant to do in the world, Kothari said. "We didn't know industries. We needed to learn them. By making [Glass] broadly available and allowing people to experiment, we were able to see what people were able to do." The biggest impact is being seen in jobs where people need to have their hands free, Kothari said. Workers, for example, can view instructions with videos, animations and images right in their line of sight, and don't have to stop and consult a binder or computer to know what to do next. Manufacturing, logistics, field service or repair, and healthcare are the four main industries Glass is focused on now, he said. The team also took a different approach to selling this technology. Kothari said they never talked about the technology; they talked about what the technology could do for a specific enterprise or use case. Google has partnered with around 50 businesses, including GE, DHL, Dignity Health, The Boeing Company and Volkswagen. A revamped Google Glass device -- with more power and better battery life -- has improved GE's mechanics' efficiency by between 8% and 12%. Package sorters at DHL have increased their efficiency by 15% by getting information projected into their line of sight via Glass, freeing up their hands. Doctors at Dignity Health have reduced the time they spend typing up patient notes and other administrative work by 33% by using Glass, Kothari touted, adding that Glass has found its groove and is moving full-steam ahead.

The 'Glasshole' effect What's the lesson the Google Glass project team learned from its wearable journey? It circles back to the need to solve a specific problem for the end user, said Melvin Chua, an executive in business development at Glass. "With any sort of new technology, in order to get adoption and roll out of production you absolutely need the ROI," Chua said during the keynote. "Even if the managers wanted this and even if there was a great business case behind it, if we couldn't satisfy the wearers -- their needs and desires -- they would not put this on when they went to work." Chua also found that when testing new wearable technology on users, it's important to find people who will consistently use the device. Your face is the most expensive human real estate there is, so putting something people don't feel good wearing is tough. Jay Kothariproject lead for Glass, X, the moonshot factory From a hardware perspective, the team also learned that people cared about what it feels like to wear the device and how they look when wearing it. "Your face is the most expensive human real estate there is, so putting something people don't feel good wearing is tough," Kothari said. In the consumer pilot, for example, Glass wearers were dubbed "Glassholes" by a derisive public, which certainly didn't help users feel good about wearing the device. "We spend a lot of time grappling with the social impacts of putting a computer and a camera on somebody's face," Kothari said.
